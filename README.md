# My Power BI Dashboard Portfolio ðŸ“Š

This repository showcases the dashboards Iâ€™ve built while learning and practicing Power BI, starting from simple reports and moving into more advanced, interactive analyses. Each project reflects my progress and focus on turning raw data into meaningful, easy-to-understand insights.

This initial dashboard provides a comprehensive two-page exploration of the data job market, designed for job seekers. It features a high-level summary page and a detailed drill-through page for specific job titles, offering a broad look at market trends and compensation.

**Key Power BI Skills Utilized:**
* Dashboard Layout & Design
* Power Query (ETL & Data Shaping)
* Basic Data Modeling (Table Relationships)
* Implicit Measures & Standard Aggregations
* Core Charts (Bar, Line, Area, Column)
* Map Visualizations for Geospatial Data
* KPI Cards & Detailed Data Tables
* Interactive Slicers for Filtering
* Buttons & Bookmarks for Page Navigation
* Drill-Through Functionality

Version 2.0 of the Data Jobs Dashboard streamlines the analysis into a highly focused, single-page experience. It's optimized to deliver the most critical insights quickly to job seekers, featuring dynamic interactions and more advanced analytical capabilities.

**Key Power BI Skills Utilized (demonstrating progression):**
* Advanced Dashboard Design (Single-Page UX & Optimization)
* Complex Power Query Transformations
* Star Schema Data Modeling Principles
* Explicit DAX Measures (e.g., `CALCULATE`, context modifiers)
* Dynamic Visualizations (driven by Parameters/Slicers)
* Field & Numeric Parameter Implementation for "What-If" Analysis
* Enhanced Geospatial Insights
* Advanced Card Visualizations
* Optimized Slicers & Advanced Cross-Filtering Techniques
* Report Performance Considerations
